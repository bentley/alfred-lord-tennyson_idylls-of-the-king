			<p>
				<span>A storm was coming, but the winds were still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the wild woods of Broceliande,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before an oak, so hollow, huge and old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It looked a tower of ivied masonwork,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Merlin’s feet the wily Vivien lay.</span>

			<p>
				<span>For he that always bare in bitter grudge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slights of Arthur and his Table, Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cornish King, had heard a wandering voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A minstrel of Caerlon by strong storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blown into shelter at Tintagil, say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That out of naked knightlike purity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the great Queen herself, fought in her name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware by her⁠—vows like theirs, that high in heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love most, but neither marry, nor are given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In marriage, angels of our Lord’s report.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ceased, and then⁠—for Vivien sweetly said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(She sat beside the banquet nearest Mark),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And is the fair example followed, Sir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s household?”⁠—answered innocently:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay, by some few⁠—ay, truly⁠—youths that hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It more beseems the perfect virgin knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To worship woman as true wife beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All hopes of gaining, than as maiden girl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They place their pride in Lancelot and the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So passionate for an utter purity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the limit of their bond, are these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Arthur bound them not to singleness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave hearts and clean! and yet⁠—God guide them⁠—young.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Mark was half in heart to hurl his cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight at the speaker, but forbore: he rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave the hall, and, Vivien following him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned to her: “Here are snakes within the grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you methinks, O Vivien, save ye fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monkish manhood, and the mask of pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn by this court, can stir them till they sting.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered, smiling scornfully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why fear? because that fostered at thy court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I savour of thy⁠—virtues? fear them? no.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Love, if Love is perfect, casts out fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Hate, if Hate is perfect, casts out fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father died in battle against the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother on his corpse in open field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bore me there, for born from death was I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the dead and sown upon the wind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then on thee! and shown the truth betimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That old true filth, and bottom of the well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Truth is hidden. Gracious lessons thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maxims of the mud! ‘This Arthur pure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives him the lie! There is no being pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?’⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy blessing, stainless King! I bring thee back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I have ferreted out their burrowings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hearts of all this Order in mine hand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay⁠—so that fate and craft and folly close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance, one curl of Arthur’s golden beard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is cleaner-fashioned⁠—Well, I loved thee first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That warps the wit.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Loud laughed the graceless Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low in the city, and on a festal day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Guinevere was crossing the great hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why kneel ye there? What evil hath ye wrought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise!” and the damsel bidden rise arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood with folded hands and downward eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father died in battle for thy King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother on his corpse⁠—in open field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonnesse⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor wretch⁠—no friend!⁠—and now by Mark the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that small charm of feature mine, pursued⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any such be mine⁠—I fly to thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save, save me thou⁠—Woman of women⁠—thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wreath of beauty, thine the crown of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be thine the balm of pity, O Heaven’s own white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth-angel, stainless bride of stainless King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help, for he follows! take me to thyself!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O yield me shelter for mine innocency</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among thy maidens!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Here her slow sweet eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt on her hearer’s, while the Queen who stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We choose the last. Our noble Arthur, him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—we believe all evil of thy Mark⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We go to prove it. Bide ye here the while.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She past; and Vivien murmured after “Go!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bide the while.” Then through the portal-arch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peering askance, and muttering broken-wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one that labours with an evil dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Is that the Lancelot? goodly⁠—ay, but gaunt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courteous⁠—amends for gauntness⁠—takes her hand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A clinging kiss⁠—how hand lingers in hand!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let go at last!⁠—they ride away⁠—to hawk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For waterfowl. Royaller game is mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such a supersensual sensual bond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch flax with flame⁠—a glance will serve⁠—the liars!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah little rat that borest in the dyke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down upon far-off cities while they dance⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or dream⁠—of thee they dreamed not⁠—nor of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These⁠—ay, but each of either: ride, and dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mortal dream that never yet was mine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ride, ride and dream until ye wake⁠—to me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will hate, loathe, fear⁠—but honour me the more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet while they rode together down the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their talk was all of training, terms of art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“She is too noble” he said “to check at pies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor will she rake: there is no baseness in her.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here when the Queen demanded as by chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know ye the stranger woman?” “Let her be,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who pounced her quarry and slew it. Many a time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As once⁠—of old⁠—among the flowers⁠—they rode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whispered: through the peaceful court she crept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whispered: then as Arthur in the highest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arriving at a time of golden rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all the heathen lay at Arthur’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no quest came, but all was joust and play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leavened his hall. They heard and let her be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereafter as an enemy that has left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wily Vivien stole from Arthur’s court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She hated all the knights, and heard in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their lavish comment when her name was named.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For once, when Arthur walking all alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vext at a rumour issued from herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some corruption crept among his knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fluttered adoration, and at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than who should prize him most; at which the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one had watched, and had not held his peace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It made the laughter of an afternoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after that, she set herself to gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him, the most famous man of all those times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people called him Wizard; whom at first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She played about with slight and sprightly talk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would watch her at her petulance, and play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perceiving that she was but half disdained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to break her sports with graver fits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn red or pale, would often when they met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would flatter his own wish in age for love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And half believe her true: for thus at times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wavered; but that other clung to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A doom that ever poised itself to fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ever-moaning battle in the mist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>World-war of dying flesh against the life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death in all life and lying in all love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The meanest having power upon the highest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the high purpose broken by the worm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So leaving Arthur’s court he gained the beach;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There found a little boat, and stept into it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Vivien followed, but he marked her not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She took the helm and he the sail; the boat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then she followed Merlin all the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Merlin once had told her of a charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The which if any wrought on anyone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With woven paces and with waving arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which was no escape for evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none could find that man for evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming and going, and he lay as dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost to life and use and name and fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Vivien ever sought to work the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fancying that her glory would be great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to his greatness whom she quenched.</span>

				<figcaption>Vivien and Merlin Enter the Woods</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if in deepest reverence and in love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of samite without price, that more exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In colour like the satin-shining palm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On sallows in the windy gleams of March:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she kissed them, crying, “Trample me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will pay you worship; tread me down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will kiss you for it;” he was mute:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As on a dull day in an Ocean cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence: wherefore, when she lifted up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Merlin, do ye love me?” and again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Merlin, do ye love me?” and once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Great Master, do ye love me?” he was mute.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, curved an arm about his neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made with her right a comb of pearl to part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lists of such a board as youth gone out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had left in ashes: then he spoke and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not looking at her, “Who are wise in love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love most, say least,” and Vivien answered quick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I saw the little elf-god eyeless once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s arras hall at Camelot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But neither eyes nor tongue⁠—O stupid child!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet you are wise who say it; let me think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silence is wisdom: I am silent then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask no kiss;” then adding all at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom,” drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across her neck and bosom to her knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called herself a gilded summer fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught in a great old tyrant spider’s web,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without one word. So Vivien called herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rather seemed a lovely baleful star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To what request for what strange boon,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these have broken up my melancholy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling saucily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bid the stranger welcome. Thanks at last!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But yesterday you never opened lip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except indeed to drink: no cup had we:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine own lady palms I culled the spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made a pretty cup of both my hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And offered you it kneeling: then you drank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O no more thanks than might a goat have given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With no more sign of reverence than a beard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when we halted at that other well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I was faint to swooning, and you lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet no thanks: and all through this wild wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all this morning when I fondled you:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But such a silence is more wise than kind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O did ye never lie upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch the curled white of the coming wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I rose and fled from Arthur’s court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break the mood. You followed me unasked;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I looked, and saw you following me still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mind involved yourself the nearest thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that mind-mist: for shall I tell you truth?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You seemed that wave about to break upon me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweep me from my hold upon the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My use and name and fame. Your pardon, child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your pretty sports have brightened all again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once for wrong done you by confusion, next</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thanks it seems till now neglected, last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these your dainty gambols: wherefore ask;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take this boon so strange and not so strange.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O not so strange as my long asking it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people call you prophet: let it be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not of those that can expound themselves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take Vivien for expounder; she will call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No presage, but the same mistrustful mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes you seem less noble than yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever I have asked this very boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now asked again: for see you not, dear love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your fancy when ye saw me following you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must make me fear still more you are not mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make me wish still more to learn this charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of woven paces and of waving hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As proof of trust. O Merlin, teach it me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore be as great as ye are named,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not muffled round with selfish reticence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How hard you look and how denyingly!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, if you think this wickedness in me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I should prove it on you unawares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had best be loosed for ever: but think or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have tript on such conjectural treachery⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I be such a traitress. Yield my boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grant my re-reiterated wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great proof of your love: because I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However wise, ye hardly know me yet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I never was less wise, however wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than when I told you first of such a charm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too much I trusted when I told you that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stirred this vice in you which ruined man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through woman the first hour; for howsoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In children a great curiousness be well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who have to learn themselves and all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you, that are no child, for still I find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your face is practised when I spell the lines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I call it⁠—well, I will not call it vice:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since you name yourself the summer fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That settles, beaten back, and beaten back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Settles, till one could yield for weariness:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since I will not yield to give you power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon my life and use and name and fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why will ye never ask some other boon?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, by God’s rood, I trusted you too much.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever bided tryst at village stile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caress her: let her feel herself forgiven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who feels no heart to ask another boon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ‘trust me not at all or all in all.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And it shall answer for me. Listen to it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith and unfaith can ne’er be equal powers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘It is the little rift within the lute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That by and by will make the music mute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever widening slowly silence all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘The little rift within the lover’s lute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rotting inward slowly moulders all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘It is not worth the keeping: let it go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trust me not at all or all in all.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin looked and half believed her true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So tender was her voice, so fair her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet he answered half indignantly:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Far other was the song that once I heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chase a creature that was current then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was the time when first the question rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the founding of a Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was to be, for love of God and men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each incited each to noble deeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We could not keep him silent, out he flashed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into such a song, such fire for fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such trumpet-glowings in it, coming down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To such a stern and iron-clashing close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And should have done it; but the beauteous beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a silver shadow slipt away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dim land; and all day long we rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dim land against a rushing wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chased the flashes of his golden horns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they vanished by the fairy well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That laughs at iron⁠—as our warriors did⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Laugh, little well!’ but touch it with a sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We lost him: such a noble song was that.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I felt as though you knew this cursed charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were proving it on me, and that I lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame.”</span>

				<figcaption>The Knights Pursue the Hart with Golden Horns</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O mine have ebbed away for evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all through following you to this wild wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As high as woman in her selfless mood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touching fame, howe’er ye scorn my song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take one verse more⁠—the lady speaks it⁠—this:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So trust me not at all or all in all.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Says she not well? and there is more⁠—this rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But nevermore the same two sister pearls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her white neck⁠—so is it with this rhyme:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It lives dispersedly in many hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every minstrel sings it differently;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet is there one true line, the pearl of pearls:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea! Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A portion from the solid present, eats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know well that Envy calls you Devil’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since ye seem the Master of all Art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fain would make you Master of all vice.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I once was looking for a magic weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found a fair young squire who sat alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then was painting on it fancied arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dexter chief; the scroll ‘I follow fame.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And speaking not, but leaning over him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I took his brush and blotted out the bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made a Gardener putting in a graff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With this for motto, ‘Rather use than fame.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You should have seen him blush; but afterwards</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made a stalwart knight. O Vivien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For you, methinks you think you love me well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For me, I love you somewhat; rest: and Love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not ever be too curious for a boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too prurient for a proof against the grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him ye say ye love: but Fame with men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being but ampler means to serve mankind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But work as vassal to the larger love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Increasing gave me use. Lo, there my boon!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What other? for men sought to prove me vile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I fain had given them greater wits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then did Envy call me Devil’s son:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sick weak beast seeking to help herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By striking at her better, missed, and brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet were the days when I was all unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when my name was lifted up, the storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet needs must work my work. That other fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one at least, who hath not children, vague,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cackle of the unborn about the grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cared not for it: a single misty star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is the second in a line of stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never gazed upon it but I dreamt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some vast charm concluded in that star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make fame nothing. Wherefore, if I fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giving you power upon me through this charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you might play me falsely, having power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However well ye think ye love me now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As sons of kings loving in pupilage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rather dread the loss of use than fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If you⁠—and not so much from wickedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As some wild turn of anger, or a mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of overstrained affection, it may be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep me all to your own self⁠—or else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sudden spurt of woman’s jealousy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have I not sworn? I am not trusted. Good!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being found take heed of Vivien.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman and not trusted, doubtless I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might feel some sudden turn of anger born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is accurate too, for this full love of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the full heart back may merit well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your term of overstrained. So used as I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My daily wonder is, I love at all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as to woman’s jealousy, O why not?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O to what end, except a jealous one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one to make me jealous if I love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was this fair charm invented by yourself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe that all about this world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which is no escape for evermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the great Master merrily answered her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Full many a love in loving youth was mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I needed then no charm to keep them mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But youth and love; and that full heart of yours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So live uncharmed. For those who wrought it first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who paced it, ages back: but will ye hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There lived a king in the most Eastern East,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less old than I, yet older, for my blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tawny pirate anchored in his port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw two cities in a thousand boats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All fighting for a woman on the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pushing his black craft among them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With loss of half his people arrow-slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They said a light came from her when she moved:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since the pirate would not yield her up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King impaled him for his piracy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then made her Queen: but those isle-nurtured eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waged such unwilling though successful war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rustiest iron of old fighters’ hearts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wonder, being jealous, that he sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horns of proclamation out through all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find a wizard who might teach the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might keep her all his own: to such a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He promised more than ever king has given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A league of mountain full of golden mines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A province with a hundred miles of coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A palace and a princess, all for him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on all those who tried and failed, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep the list low and pretenders back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or like a king, not to be trifled with⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their heads should moulder on the city gates.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many tried and failed, because the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of nature in her overbore their own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many weeks a troop of carrion crows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy tongue has tript a little: ask thyself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lady never made unwilling war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With those fine eyes: she had her pleasure in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made her good man jealous with good cause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lived there neither dame nor damsel then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth at a lover’s loss? were all as tame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, those were not our days: but did they find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wizard? Tell me, was he like to thee?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her new lord, her own, the first of men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He answered laughing, “Nay, not like to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last they found⁠—his foragers for charms⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little glassy-headed hairless man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Read but one book, and ever reading grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So grated down and filed away with thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard their voices talk behind the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learnt their elemental secrets, powers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forces; often o’er the sun’s bright eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world to peace again: here was the man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so by force they dragged him to the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he taught the King to charm the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such-wise, that no man could see her more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming and going, and she lay as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost all use of life: but when the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made proffer of the league of golden mines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The province with a hundred miles of coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace and the princess, that old man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vanished, and his book came down to me.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling saucily:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye have the book: the charm is written in it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good: take my counsel: let me know it at once:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As after furious battle turfs the slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On some wild down above the windy deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I yet should strike upon a sudden means</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And smiling as a master smiles at one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is not of his school, nor any school</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that where blind and naked Ignorance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On all things all day long, he answered her:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O ay, it is but twenty pages long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But every page having an ample marge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every marge enclosing in the midst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A square of text that looks a little blot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every square of text an awful charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writ in a language that has long gone by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long, that mountains have arisen since</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cities on their flanks⁠—thou read the book!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever margin scribbled, crost, and crammed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With comment, densest condensation, hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my long life have made it easy to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none can read the text, not even I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none can read the comment but myself;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the comment did I find the charm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, the results are simple; a mere child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might use it to the harm of anyone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never could undo it: ask no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though you should not prove it upon me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But keep that oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assay it on someone of the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all because ye dream they babble of you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What dare the full-fed liars say of me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ride abroad redressing human wrongs!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bound to holy vows of chastity!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But you are man, you well can understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shame that cannot be explained for shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one of all the drove should touch me: swine!”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Then answered Merlin careless of her words:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“You breathe but accusation vast and vague,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spleen-born, I think, and proofless. If ye know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose kinsman left him watcher o’er his wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was one year gone, and on returning found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one hour old! What said the happy sire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A seven-months’ babe had been a truer gift.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Merlin, “Nay, I know the tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One child they had: it lived with her: she died:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kinsman travelling on his own affair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He brought, not found it therefore: take the truth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O ay,” said Vivien, “overtrue a tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ardent man? ‘to pluck the flower in season,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So says the song, ‘I trow it is no treason.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Master, shall we call him overquick</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin answered, “Overquick art thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is man’s good name: he never wronged his bride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know the tale. An angry gust of wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many-corridored complexities</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur’s palace: then he found a door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And darkling felt the sculptured ornament</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wreathen round it made it seem his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wearied out made for the couch and slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stainless man beside a stainless maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And either slept, nor knew of other there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s casement glimmered chastely down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blushing upon them blushing, and at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rose without a word and parted from her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the thing was blazed about the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brute world howling forced them into bonds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as it chanced they are happy, being pure.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O ay,” said Vivien, “that were likely too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or some black wether of <abbr>St.</abbr> Satan’s fold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, in the precincts of the chapel-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the knightly brasses of the graves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin answered careless of her charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A sober man is Percivale and pure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But once in life was flustered with new wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where one of Satan’s shepherdesses caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meant to stamp him with her master’s mark;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that he sinned is not believable;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, look upon his face!⁠—but if he sinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sin that practice burns into the blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To which he answered sadly, “Yea, I know it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rumour runs, she took him for the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fixt her fancy on him: let them be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But have ye no one word of loyal praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By which the good King means to blind himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blinds himself and all the Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the foulness that they work. Myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could call him (were it not for womanhood)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pretty, popular cause such manhood earns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could call him the main cause of all their crime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O true and tender! O my liege and King!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O selfless man and stainless gentleman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have all men true and leal, all women pure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, in the mouths of base interpreters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From over-fineness not intelligible</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To things with every sense as false and foul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the poached filth that floods the middle street,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By instance, recommenced, and let her tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rage like a fire among the noblest names,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Polluting, and imputing her whole self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Defaming and defacing, till she left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her words had issue other than she willed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And muttered in himself, “Tell her the charm!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, if she had it, would she rail on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To snare the next, and if she have it not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So will she rail. What did the wanton say?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Not mount as high;’ we scarce can sink as low:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know the Table Round, my friends of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe she tempted them and failed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so bitter: for fine plots may fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though harlots paint their talk as well as face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With colours of the heart that are not theirs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not let her know: nine tithes of times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanting the mental range; or low desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to feel lowest makes them level all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave an equal baseness; and in this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some stain or blemish in a name of note,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not grieving that their greatest are so small,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inflate themselves with some insane delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And judge all nature from her feet of clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the will to lift their eyes, and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touching other worlds. I am weary of her.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-suffocated in the hoary fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hearing “harlot” muttered twice or thrice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How from the rosy lips of life and love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flashed the bare-grinning skeleton of death!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feeling; had she found a dagger there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For in a wink the false love turns to hate)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eye was calm, and suddenly she took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bitter weeping like a beaten child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A long, long weeping, not consolable.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O crueller than was ever told in tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sung in song! O vainly lavished love!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or seeming shameful⁠—for what shame in love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So love be true, and not as yours is⁠—nothing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who called her what he called her⁠—all her crime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All⁠—all⁠—the wish to prove him wholly hers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She mused a little, and then clapt her hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together with a wailing shriek, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stabbed through the heart’s affections to the heart!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seethed like the kid in its own mother’s milk!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought that he was gentle, being great:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O God, that I had loved a smaller man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should have found in him a greater heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loved to make men darker than they are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because of that high pleasure which I had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seat you sole upon my pedestal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of worship⁠—I am answered, and henceforth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The course of life that seemed so flowery to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With you for guide and master, only you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ending in a ruin⁠—nothing left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But into some low cave to crawl, and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed with inutterable unkindliness.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence, while his anger slowly died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within him, till he let his wisdom go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ease of heart, and half believed her true:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called her to shelter in the hollow oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come from the storm,” and having no reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last she let herself be conquered by him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the cageling newly flown returns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to her old perch back, and settled there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About her, more in kindness than in love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she dislinked herself at once and rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upright and flushed before him: then she said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There must now be no passages of love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since, if I be what I am grossly called,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What should be granted which your own gross heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would reckon worth the taking? I will go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In truth, but one thing now⁠—better have died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice than have asked it once⁠—could make me stay⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That proof of trust⁠—so often asked in vain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How justly, after that vile term of yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I find with grief! I might believe you then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows? once more. Lo! what was once to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast necessity of heart and life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My fate or folly, passing gayer youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one so old, must be to love thee still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere I leave thee let me swear once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if I schemed against thy peace in this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May yon just heaven, that darkens o’er me, send</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One flash, that, missing all things else, may make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For now the storm was close above them) struck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With darted spikes and splinters of the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dark earth round. He raised his eyes and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That followed, flying back and crying out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Merlin, though you do not love me, save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet save me!” clung to him and hugged him close;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called him dear protector in her fright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pale blood of the wizard at her touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took gayer colours, like an opal warmed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She blamed herself for telling hearsay tales:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shook from fear, and for her fault she wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of petulancy; she called him lord and liege,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her whole life; and ever overhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bellowed the tempest, and the rotten branch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snapt in the rushing of the river-rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above them; and in change of glare and gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes and neck glittering went and came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now the storm, its burst of passion spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moaning and calling out of other lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had left the ravaged woodland yet once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To peace; and what should not have been had been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Merlin, overtalked and overworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept.</span>

				<span>Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of woven paces and of waving hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the hollow oak he lay as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost to life and use and name and fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then crying “I have made his glory mine,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrieking out “O fool!” the harlot leapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown the forest, and the thicket closed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind her, and the forest echoed “fool.”</span>
