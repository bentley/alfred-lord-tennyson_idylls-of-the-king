			<p>
				<span>These to His Memory⁠—since he held them dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance as finding there unconsciously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some image of himself⁠—I dedicate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dedicate, I consecrate with tears⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These Idylls.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And indeed He seems to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce other than my king’s ideal knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who reverenced his conscience as his king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose glory was, redressing human wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loved one only and who clave to her⁠—”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her⁠—over all whose realms to their last isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commingled with the gloom of imminent war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darkening the world. We have lost him: he is gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We know him now: all narrow jealousies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are silent; and we see him as he moved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With what sublime repression of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in what limits, and how tenderly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not swaying to this faction or to that;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not making his high place the lawless perch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of winged ambitions, nor a vantage-ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pleasure; but through all this tract of years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a thousand peering littlenesses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that fierce light which beats upon a throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blackens every blot: for where is he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dares foreshadow for an only son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how should England dreaming of his sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hope more for these than some inheritance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of such a life, a heart, a mind as thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou noble Father of her Kings to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laborious for her people and her poor⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of letters, dear to Science, dear to Art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all titles, and a household name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter, through all times, Albert the Good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Break not, O woman’s-heart, but still endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering all the beauty of that star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One light together, but has past and leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Crown a lonely splendour.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>May all love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His love, unseen but felt, o’ershadow Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The love of all Thy daughters cherish Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The love of all Thy people comfort Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till God’s love set Thee at his side again!</span>
